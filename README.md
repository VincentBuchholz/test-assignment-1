## Reflections 

### Shooting 1.1: 
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.

- She did not hit him at all
- She did not hit him a vital spot 
- She fired a blank shot
- He was to far away from her, so the bullet didn't do lethal damage
- The man was wearing bodyarmor which stopped the bullet.
- He was hit critically but was saved by paramedics


### Alien
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the
toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)

1. Get the toothpaste and hold it in your right hand. 
2. Use you left hand to unscrew the cap counter-clockwise.
3. Once the toothpaste is opened, swap it over to your non-dominant hand.
4. Take the toothbrush into your dominant hand, hold in by the handle and make sure the bristles face upwards.
5. Then put the toothpaste on the toothbrush by holding the opening over the bristles and squeezing lighty until have a small amount of toothpaste on the toothbrush, about the size of a human little finger nail.
6. Carefully close the toothpaste again, while making sure you dont drop your toothbrush.
7. Put the toothpaste away. You are now ready to start brushing.
8. Start brushing your teeth back and forth in a circular motion.
9. make sure you don't swallow the toothpaste.
10. Make sure you brush all teeth on all sides for at least 2 min, but also not much longer. 
11. Once finished brushing your teeth rinse your mouth with water.
12. lastly rinse the toothbrush with water and put it away for next use.



## Give your thoughts on TDD

### What was positive and good about using TDD?

It helped me catch errors quickly, fx. making the arabic to roman converter, i didn't think about roman numerals for 90, 400 and 900
And at the same time i was confident that my code worked as intended when all my tests passed.

### What was annoying or difficult?

Finding the right test cases to ensure that the code does what was intended.


### What surprised you?
How useful it actually is in the end, to have written test beforehand. 

### Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?

I probably wrote more tests than i otherwise would have done, as i would think that i know what my code does.
